- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ant-Sentanaut
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code things from scratch
- 🌱 I’m currently at the start, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate but I'm also not <i>not</i> looking to collaborate on anything also.
- 📫 How to reach me: on github I guess? I've not used it at all but I assume there's some sort of messaging function.
